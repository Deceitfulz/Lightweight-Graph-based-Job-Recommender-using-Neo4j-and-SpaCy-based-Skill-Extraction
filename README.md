# Lightweight Graph-based Job Recommender using Neo4j and spaCy-based Skill Extraction

This project is a lightweight, open-source job recommendation system that leverages graph-based modeling in Neo4j and natural language processing using spaCy to extract skills from user profiles and job postings. It aims to deliver efficient job recommendations by modeling relationships between people, skills, and jobs as a graph.

## üìå Features

- Skill extraction from LinkedIn profiles and job descriptions using spaCy
- Graph construction in Neo4j: `Person`, `Job`, and `Skill` nodes with relationships like `HAS_SKILL` and `REQUIRES`
- Querying job recommendations through Neo4j Cypher
- Lightweight, local-first, and LLM-free
- Open-source and reproducible using CSV data
